# Agri-Aqua

Optimizing Irrigation with Machine Learning

Agri-Aqua is a smart irrigation system that uses machine learning models to predict crop survival based on weather patterns and user input. By combining data analytics with an intuitive interface, the project helps farmers and agricultural enthusiasts make informed decisions to optimize water usage and improve crop health.

Features
✅ Predict crop survival using Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression models
✅ High model accuracy (92%) based on historical data and real-time inputs
✅ User-friendly frontend for inputting data and viewing predictions
✅ Seamless integration between frontend, backend, and ML models

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Python, Flask

ML Libraries: scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

How It Works
Users input key parameters like soil type, moisture, weather forecast, and crop type.

The system processes this data through trained ML models.

It returns a prediction on whether the crop is likely to survive under the given conditions.

The results help guide irrigation planning and water management.
